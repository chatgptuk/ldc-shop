## 🚀 Deployment Guide


### ⭐ Recommended: Cloudflare Workers (One-Click Deploy)

Higher free tier, faster global access, no cold start delay.

[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/chatgptuk/ldc-shop)

Click the button above to fork and deploy to Cloudflare Workers in one click. After deployment, you still need to:

1. **Create D1 Database** (if not auto-created): Cloudflare Dashboard → Storage & Databases → D1 → Create database, name it `ldc-shop-next`
2. **Configure Environment Variables**: Go to project Settings → Variables and Secrets, add `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, `MERCHANT_ID`, `MERCHANT_KEY`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `ADMIN_USERS`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` (Text type)
3. **Redeploy**: After configuration, manually trigger the **Deploy to Cloudflare Workers** workflow in GitHub Actions

> For detailed configuration, see: **[Workers Deployment Guide → `_workers_next/README.md`](./_workers_next/README.md)**

### Alternative: Vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fchatgptuk%2Fldc-shop&env=OAUTH_CLIENT_ID,OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET,MERCHANT_ID,MERCHANT_KEY,ADMIN_USERS,NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL&envDescription=Required%20Environment%20Variables&project-name=ldc-shop&repository-name=ldc-shop&stores=%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22postgres%22%7D%5D)

Click the button above for one-click deploy to Vercel with auto-provisioned Postgres database.

## 💡 Recommendation: Custom Domain

While the system supports active order status querying, for the best user experience (instant payment status updates), we still **recommend** binding a custom domain (e.g., `store.yourdomain.com`).

The shared `vercel.app` domain is sometimes flagged by firewalls or payment gateways, which might delay or block payment callbacks. Using a custom domain avoids these issues.

## 🐳 Docker Deployment (Docker Compose)

> ⚠️ **Experimental**: Docker deployment has not been fully tested and may have unknown issues. **We recommend using Vercel deployment** for better stability.

If you have your own server (VPS/NAS), you can deploy simply with Docker:

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chatgptuk/ldc-shop.git
    cd ldc-shop
    ```
2.  Edit `docker-compose.yml` environment variables:
    - This file starts a local PostgreSQL database by default.
    - **Crucial**: Replace `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, `MERCHANT_ID`, `MERCHANT_KEY` with your actual credentials.
3.  Start the service:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
4.  Visit `http://localhost:3000`.
    - Database data is persisted in the local `./postgres-data` folder.

## 🔄 How to Enable Auto Update

If you forked this project, you can enable GitHub Actions to automatically sync the latest code from upstream (triggering a Vercel redeploy):

1.  Go to your GitHub repository page.
2.  Click the **Actions** tab.
3.  Select **Upstream Sync** from the left sidebar.
4.  Click the **Enable workflow** button.
5.  (Optional) Click **Run workflow** to test it manually.

Once enabled, the script will check for updates from `chatgptuk/ldc-shop:main` daily and merge them into your repository.


## ⚙️ Configuration Guide
